     ~ What is glich_replace?

       glitch_replace is a self-contained library for 
       renovating images as glitch art.


     ~ Examples of glitch_effect?

       Take a gander at the folder, info, for the 
       post effects of images run through glitch_effect
       along with their pre selves.


     ~ What do I need?

       `cabal install` will download any Haskell
       libraries required by glich_replace. However,
       later in development non-native
       Haskell libraries may be used. But, we'll 
       get to that when the time comes.


     ~ Where are the docs?
