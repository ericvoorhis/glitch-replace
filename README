     ~ What is Salad?

       Salad is a self-contained library for 
       producing fresh and crisp glitch art.


     ~ Examples of Salad?

       Take a gander at the folder, info, for the 
       post effects of images run through Salad
       along with their pre self.


     ~ What do I need?

       `cabal install` will download any Haskell
       libraries required by Salad. However,
       later in development non-native
       Haskell libraries may be used. But, we'll 
       get to that when the time comes.


     ~ Where are the docs?
